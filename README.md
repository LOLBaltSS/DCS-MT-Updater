# DCS-MT-Updater

Pre-requesites and overview:
This assumes you are utilizing DCS OpenBeta on the Standalone install since Steam will automatically update for you anyways.  This is primarily a shortcut for the people who want to run the multi-threaded DCS executable but not want to wait until Eagle Dynamics supports automatic updates on the multi-threaded executable.

Instructions:
Copy the "Update and Start DCS MT.ps1" to a location of your choosing.  Edit the "DCS MT.lnk" file and set the "Start in:" path to the location you saved the PS1 script.  Run the shortcut and it should run the updater and then launch DCS using the multi-threaded binary once the updater is closed.  Pin the shortcut to start or place on your desktop as you wish.
